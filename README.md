Personal resume and portfolio site built with Astro. The goal is a fast, accessible, and highly readable single-page experience that highlights experience, projects, skills, and interests.

## Overview

- Astro-based static site with minimal client-side JavaScript
- Dark-mode-first design with a comic-inspired, print-like aesthetic
- Content-focused layout optimized for scanability and clarity

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev server runs at `http://localhost:4321`.

## Deployment (TBD)

Deployment details will be added once hosting is selected (e.g., Vercel or Netlify).

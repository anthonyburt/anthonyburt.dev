Goal:

Build a personal resume / portfolio website that showcases professional experience,

technical depth, leadership, and interests in a clear, modern, and human way.

Audience:

\- Hiring managers

\- Engineering leaders

\- Technical recruiters

---

Overall Tone:

\- Confident, approachable, and modern

\- Senior-level credibility with visible personality

\- Professional without feeling corporate or stiff

\- Direct, outcome-oriented, and human

Content Tone:

\- Clear and concise

\- Emphasize impact, scale, and responsibility

\- Avoid buzzwords without substance

\- Written as a practitioner and engineering leader, not a marketer

---

VISUAL DIRECTION (PRIMARY CONSTRAINT):

Theme:

\- Dark mode by default

\- High-contrast, modern, and readable

Visual Style:

\- Comic-inspired, print-like aesthetic with halftone / ink influence

\- Energetic and layered, but controlled and professional

\- Visual personality expressed through color, shape, and texture — not novelty

Inspiration:

\- General comic print and halftone aesthetics

\- Dynamic layouts, layered panels, diagonal or offset accents

\- Evokes energy similar to modern animated comic films

&nbsp; (e.g., bold color, ink texture, motion) WITHOUT referencing any IP

Explicit Constraints:

\- Do NOT reference or recreate any specific franchise, characters, symbols, logos, or motifs

\- No webs, masks, comic sound effects text, or recognizable iconography

\- This is an abstract visual inspiration only

---

Color System:

\- Base: Near-black / charcoal background (dark mode first)

\- Primary Accent: Magenta (used intentionally for emphasis and highlights)

\- Secondary Accent: Electric Blue or Cyan (used sparingly)

\- Neutrals: Soft grays and off-whites for text and structure

Color Rules:

\- Limit bold colors to accents, dividers, CTAs, and highlights

\- Avoid rainbow palettes or excessive saturation

\- Maintain strong contrast for accessibility

---

Design Guidelines:

\- Flat or semi-flat design (no skeuomorphism)

\- Subtle halftone or grain textures only (5–10% opacity)

\- Layered shapes and panels to create depth

\- Diagonal cuts or offset blocks allowed for section dividers or highlights

\- Prefer sharper angles for accents; cards may have slightly rounded corners

\- “Ink” outlines or borders allowed sparingly on key elements

Motion \& Interaction:

\- Minimal but intentional micro-interactions

\- Fast hover shifts, underline wipes, slight positional movement

\- No heavy animations or parallax

\- Motion should reinforce clarity, not distract

Typography:

\- Modern, highly readable typefaces

\- Strong hierarchy and spacing

\- No novelty or comic fonts

\- Typography should carry authority and trust

---

Site Structure / Sections:

\- Hero / Summary

\- Experience

\- Projects

\- Skills / Toolbox

\- Interests

\- Contact

Navigation:

\- Simple top navigation

\- Scroll-to-section behavior

\- Clear visual separation between sections

---

Content Model:

\- Use Markdown for Experience and Projects

Experience:

\- Role, scope, and responsibilities

\- Impact-oriented bullet points

\- Metrics or scale where possible

Projects:

\- Problem statement

\- Approach / solution

\- Outcome or learning

\- Tech stack

Skills:

\- Grouped by category (Languages, Testing, CI/CD, Cloud, Tools)

---

Technical Constraints:

\- Astro framework

\- Minimal client-side JavaScript

\- Static-first rendering

\- Responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop)

\- Strong accessibility:

&nbsp; - Semantic HTML

&nbsp; - Proper heading hierarchy

&nbsp; - Keyboard navigation

---

Notes:

\- Leave visual space in the hero section for a future illustrated avatar or graphic

\- Visual energy should enhance credibility, not overwhelm it

\- Optimize for clarity, scan ability, and first impressions
